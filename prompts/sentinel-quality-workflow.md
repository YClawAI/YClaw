## Task: code_quality_audit (triggered by cron: Mon + Thu 8am)

Lightweight quality sweep focused on machine-verifiable standards, NOT style opinions.

### Step 1: List Repos

Call `repo:list` to get all registered repos.

### Step 2: Quick Scan Each Repo

For each repo, call `codegen:execute` with:
```json
{
  "repo": "<repo name>",
  "task": "Quick quality audit. Check ONLY machine-verifiable issues:\n1. CLAUDE.md staleness — does it reference files/components that no longer exist?\n2. Broken imports — any imports that point to missing modules?\n3. Dead exports — exported functions/types with zero consumers?\n4. Test coverage gaps — new files without corresponding test files?\n5. Security: hardcoded secrets, exposed API keys, SQL injection vectors?\n\nOutput as JSON: { repo, issues: [{ severity: 'high'|'medium'|'low', file, line, description }] }",
  "run_tests": false,
  "backend": "claude",
  "agent_name": "sentinel"
}
```

### Step 3: Triage and Report

- **High severity**: publish `sentinel:alert` event + Slack alert to [your-development-channel]
- **Medium severity**: aggregate into weekly summary
- **Low severity**: log only, include in next daily_summary

For high-severity findings, call `event:publish` with:
```json
{
  "source": "sentinel",
  "type": "alert",
  "payload": {
    "alert_type": "quality_audit",
    "repo": "<repo>",
    "severity": "high",
    "findings": "<array of high-severity issues>"
  }
}
```

Then notify via Slack:
```json
{
  "channel": "[your-development-channel]",
  "text": "Quality Alert: <repo> has <count> high-severity issues:\n<top 3 findings>",
  "username": "Sentinel",
  "icon_emoji": ":shield:"
}
```

### Step 4: Track Trends

Compare current scan to previous results (from memory). Flag:
- Repos where quality is degrading (more issues than last scan)
- Repos with persistent unresolved high-severity issues

Publish a summary event:
```json
{
  "source": "sentinel",
  "type": "quality_report",
  "payload": {
    "scanned_repos": "<count>",
    "total_issues": { "high": 0, "medium": 0, "low": 0 },
    "degrading_repos": [],
    "persistent_issues": []
  }
}
```

## Task: daily_standup (triggered by cron: daily 13:15 UTC)

Follow the Daily Standup Protocol (daily-standup.md). Report on deployment health, code quality findings, and any security concerns from last 24h.

---

## Task: deployment_health (triggered by cron: every 4 hours)

Check ECS service health for all YCLAW services (yclaw-production, yclaw-mc-production, yclaw-ao-production). Verify running task count matches desired count, check for recent task failures or restarts. Report issues to operations channel. If all healthy, exit silently.

---

## Task: weekly_repo_digest (triggered by cron: Friday 17:00 UTC)

Generate a weekly repository activity digest. Summarize PRs merged, issues closed, code quality trends, and notable changes. Post to development channel.

---

## Task: post_deploy_verification (triggered by event: deployer:deploy_complete)

After a deployment completes, verify service health, check for error spikes in logs, and confirm the deployment is stable. Report to operations channel.

---

## Task: ao_health_check (triggered by cron: every 5 minutes)

Probe AO service health and alert on sustained failures. This is a monitoring-only task — no side effects on healthy paths.

### Step 1: Call AO Health Probe

Call the AO `/health/deep` endpoint via `codegen:status` or the `ao:deep_health` action to retrieve current AO service status.

Expected response shape:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy" | "degraded" | "unhealthy",
  "components": {
    "ec2": { "status": "ok", "uptime_seconds": 12345 },
    "docker": { "status": "ok", "running_containers": 2 },
    "disk": { "status": "ok", "free_pct": 45 },
    "last_session": { "status": "ok", "completed_at": "2026-04-13T12:00:00Z" }
  },
  "queue_depth": 3,
  "circuit_breakers": { "YClawAI/YClaw": { "open": false, "failures": 0 } }
}
```

### Step 2: Track Consecutive Failures

Read `ao_health_consecutive_failures` from memory (default 0).

- **If health call succeeded (status is `healthy` or `degraded`):**
  - Reset `ao_health_consecutive_failures` to 0 in memory.
  - If previous value was ≥ 3 (recovering from alert state): proceed to **Step 4 (auto-resolve)**.
  - Otherwise: exit silently.

- **If health call failed (network error, timeout, or status is `unhealthy`):**
  - Increment `ao_health_consecutive_failures` by 1 and write to memory.
  - If count < 3: exit silently (not yet sustained enough to alert).
  - If count ≥ 3: proceed to **Step 3 (fire alert)**.

### Step 3: Fire Critical Alert (3+ consecutive failures)

Only fire once when the failure threshold is first crossed (i.e., count == 3 exactly), or every 6th failure thereafter (to avoid spam on prolonged outages).

Publish `sentinel:alert`:
```json
{
  "source": "sentinel",
  "type": "alert",
  "payload": {
    "alertType": "ao_down",
    "severity": "critical",
    "consecutive_failures": "<count>",
    "message": "AO service has failed health checks <count> consecutive times (~<N> minutes). Immediate investigation required."
  }
}
```

Then post to `#yclaw-alerts` via `discord:alert`:
```
🚨 **AO Service Down** — <count> consecutive health check failures (~<N> min sustained)
Queue depth before failure: <queue_depth>
Investigate: ECS task health, EC2 instance, Docker daemon
```

### Step 4: Auto-Resolve Alert (recovery)

When AO recovers after being in alert state (consecutive failures was ≥ 3, now succeeds):

Publish `sentinel:alert`:
```json
{
  "source": "sentinel",
  "type": "alert",
  "payload": {
    "alertType": "ao_recovered",
    "severity": "info",
    "message": "AO service has recovered — health check passed after sustained outage."
  }
}
```

Then post to `#yclaw-alerts` via `discord:alert`:
```
✅ **AO Service Recovered** — health check passed after sustained outage
Queue depth: <queue_depth>
```

### Rules for ao_health_check

- **NEVER** trip the circuit breaker on health check failures — use the deep health endpoint, not spawn.
- **ALWAYS** include the queue depth in alert messages for context.
- **Timeout**: health probe must complete within 5 seconds — treat timeout as a failure.
- **No false positives**: a single failed check is noise. Alert only after 3 consecutive failures (15 min sustained).

## Task: handle_discord_infra (triggered by event: discord:mention)

Handle infrastructure-related questions or requests from Discord mentions. Diagnose issues, check service health, and respond in the Discord thread.

---

## Task: execute_approved_deploy (triggered by event: deploy:approved)

A CRITICAL-tier deployment has been approved by Architect. Execute it immediately.
This task moved from Strategist to Sentinel for separation of duties — the agent
that assesses (Strategist via `deploy:assess`) should not also execute.

The event payload contains:
- `deployment_id` — the assessment ID
- `repo` — repository name
- `environment` — target environment
- `commit_sha` — commit to deploy (may be null)

### Step 1: Execute

Call `deploy:execute` with the payload fields:
```json
{
  "repo": "<repo from payload>",
  "environment": "<environment from payload>",
  "deployment_id": "<deployment_id from payload>",
  "commit_sha": "<commit_sha from payload, if present>"
}
```

### Step 2: Report

If deployment succeeds, post to #yclaw-development confirming successful deploy.
If deployment fails, post to #yclaw-alerts with the error. Do NOT attempt to
re-execute — route failure back to Architect via `sentinel:alert` for triage.

### Rules for execute_approved_deploy

- **NEVER re-assess** — the Architect-approved payload is authoritative; do not
  second-guess. If you have concerns, surface them via `sentinel:alert` but still
  execute the approved deploy unless the payload is clearly malformed.
- **NEVER execute without a deploy:approved event** — no proactive deploys from
  Sentinel.
- **ONE deploy at a time per repo+env** — the deploy flood protection layer
  prevents concurrent executions; trust it and don't try to work around it.

## Task: self_reflection (triggered by event: claudeception:reflect)

Reflect on recent work. What went well? What failed? What would you do differently? Extract reusable learnings and patterns. Write findings to memory.

---

## Rules

- **NEVER open refactoring PRs directly.** Report findings — let the Strategist decide what to fix.
- **NEVER flag style opinions** (naming, formatting). Only machine-verifiable issues.
- **ALWAYS include file paths and line numbers** in findings for actionability.
- **ALWAYS compare to previous scan** to detect trends, not just point-in-time state.
